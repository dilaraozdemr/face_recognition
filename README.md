# Sleep Apnea Detection

An application was developed in Flutter that helps detect if a person has sleep apnea with the support of artificial intelligence. It takes a photo of the user's eye and sends it to MediaPipe to determine whether the eye is open or closed. It also captures sound from the phone's microphone. Then, it categorizes this data using Firebase and helps determine if the user has sleep apnea.
